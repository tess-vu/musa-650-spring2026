(two-class pixel classification)

Things I want to talk about:
- What validation metrics mean
- Why having multiple models is important
- Why do we need to plot NDVI? (intuition, baseline, understanding data)
- Selection of training data
- Can we apply SHAP to explain the models? Possibly extension here
- How does this build on previous weeks? (e.g., indices, data reshaping, classification, XGBoost versus deep learning
- What are the strengths of different model types?) (Maybe have them add xgboost, for example, or deep learning) What are the limitations? What about explainability?
- What about balance in training classes?
- What do you think the impact of adding more classes would be?
